# Settings map

Settings is grouped into four sections. This page lists what is on each screen, in the order the
app shows them.

## Your Home

*Identity and connection.*

### Account

Your profile as this app knows it.

- **Name** and **avatar image**
- **Person entity** — which `person.*` entity is you
- **Birthday**

### Connection

- **Home Assistant instances** — the list of homes, the active one, rename and remove, and
  **Add Home Assistant instance**. Each home keeps its own login, dashboard, notification and
  location settings. Swipe left from the upper-right edge of the dashboard to switch.
- **Active connection** — current status and which route is in use, with **Refresh connection**.
- **Remote access (optional)** — external URL or Nabu Casa URL.
- **Local network (optional)** — internal URL plus home Wi-Fi names, with **Add current network**.
  On those networks the app connects via the internal URL.
- **Connection log** — a live diagnostic of connection attempts, reconnects, sync and
  subscriptions. Last 300 lines, cleared on every app launch, with copy and clear buttons.
- **Maintenance** — **Restart Home Assistant**. Administrative, disruptive, and deliberately the
  last thing on the screen.

### Location

*Device tracker and geocoded location.*

- **Device tracker** — the master switch
- **Android location permission** — current state: allowed always / while using / not allowed,
  with **Allow all the time**
- **Battery optimisation** — with **Disable battery optimisation**
- **Background usage** — unrestricted is what presence needs
- **Update location now**
- **High accuracy mode** — continuous GPS for live tracking; uses much more battery

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Presence and location](../guide/presence.md)

## Personalize

*Dashboards, visual style, and everyday navigation.*

### Dashboard

The subtitle shows whether the dashboard is in **Automatic** or **Manual** mode.

- **Dashboards** — create, switch, duplicate, delete
- **Navigation bar** — order and visibility, and **Create custom page**. Home and Rooms are always
  shown
- **Media players** — rename players and choose which may appear in the media bar
- **Popups** — create and edit shared custom popups

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Dashboards](../guide/dashboards.md)
[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Custom pages](../guide/custom-pages.md)

### Appearance

*Theme and navigation bar.*

- **Visual style** — colour, typography and component shape
- **Theme** — mode (System / Light / Dark) and colour (System / Rose / Green / Blue / Amber /
  Custom), plus separate system light and dark theme colours
- **Fonts** — text size, boldness (Thinner −200 → Boldest +300), and font family with a preview
- **Language** — follow the system, or pick one of 14 locales
- **Corners** — Sharp / Modern / Round, applied to every button, card and widget
- **Icons** — animated entity icons, and the four weather-animation switches
- **Header** — full or compact dashboard header
- **Force high refresh rate**

## Services & Data

*Messages, safety and portability.*

### Notifications

*Push delivery and history.*

- An explanation that notifications are delivered over the app's live connection whenever it is
  open — send them from Home Assistant with the notify service for this device, and swipe in from
  the left edge to see the history
- **Background notifications** — keeps a persistent connection while the app is closed; required
  while multiple homes receive notifications
- **Hide Connection Notification** — turns off the "Notification connection" channel; the
  connection keeps working, only its notification disappears
- **Event timeline** — a pointer to where it is configured, since that is set once for the whole
  family rather than per device

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Notifications](../guide/notifications.md)

### Backup & Restore

*Save or restore dashboard configuration.*

- Local file, Google Drive, and Home Assistant destinations
- Daily automatic Google Drive backup, keeping the newest 14
- Restore from any listed backup

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Backup and restore](../guide/backup.md)

### Family Sharing

*Parental controls, dashboard sharing and permissions.* Needs the
[HKI 7 Cloud](https://github.com/jimz011/HKI7-Cloud-Component) component, and is admin-only.

Tabs: **Dashboards**, **Parental controls**, **Permissions**, **Presence**, **Devices**,
**Events**. Each says for itself if it needs a newer component than the one installed.

[:octicons-arrow-right-24: Family sharing](../guide/family-sharing.md)

## Home Assistant

*Your server's own pages, opened full screen inside HKI 7.* **Administrators only** — the pages
behind these links administer Home Assistant itself, so the category is hidden for everyone else.
Admin status comes from Home Assistant's own `auth/current_user`, so it does not depend on the
HKI 7 Cloud component. Also hidden on the demo home, which has no server behind it.

| Entry | Opens |
| --- | --- |
| **Home Assistant settings** | Integrations, devices, areas and automations |
| **Developer tools** | States, services, templates and events |
| **HACS** | Community integrations and frontend add-ons |

Each opens already signed in. The frontend asks the app for a short-lived token as it boots, over
the same `external_auth` bridge the official companion app uses — nothing is copied into the page's
storage, and a token is never handed to a document that is not on your server's own origin.

Home Assistant's sidebar is hidden, since HKI 7's own header already provides Back and Close. Back
walks the page's own history first, so a settings page several levels deep steps back through them
before the page closes.

## HKI 7

*Project information, licensing and community support.*

### About

What HKI 7 is and how it is built. Also where **app updates** live: HKI 7 can watch the GitHub
releases once a day and tell you when a newer version is out, which matters if you installed the
APK yourself rather than from Google Play. **Update now** goes to Play or to the release page
depending on where this copy came from — an app distributed through Play may not update itself by
any other route.

### License

Open-source and premium licensing.

### Support

Ways to help the project without buying Premium.
