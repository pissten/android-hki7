"""Shared model for the translations/*.csv exports.

export_translations.py writes these files, import_translations.py reads them back. Both agree
here on the columns, the locale list, and — the fiddly part — how Android's escaping maps onto
text a human can read in a spreadsheet.

The escaping contract, deliberately minimal so that import(export(x)) == x:

    \\'  in XML          <->  a plain apostrophe in the CSV
    &amp; and friends   <->  the bare character

Everything else rides through verbatim, backslash and all. That means a translator sees `\\n`
for a line break and `\\u0020` for a hard space rather than something prettier, which is the
right trade: those carry meaning, and silently rewriting them would corrupt the string. The
notes column says so.

Going back to XML, an apostrophe is always re-escaped — an unescaped one is the single most
common way a translation contribution breaks the Android build.

Double quotes are deliberately left alone in both directions. aapt only treats them specially
when they wrap an entire value (where they mark preserved whitespace and get stripped); the app
ships several hundred unescaped mid-string quotes and builds fine. Rewriting them here would
churn those lines for nothing, so the importer warns about the wrapping case instead.
